								I am an Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My hosts are Prof. Avishai Dekel and Dr. Nir Mandelker. I am interested in the physics of dark matter, 
								whose particle nature remains unknown. I am also interested in galaxies and star clusters, how they form and evolve, 
								and how their structure and dynamics (and those of other astrophysical objects such as black holes and tidal streams) 
								can be used to learn about dark matter.
							</p>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								I obtained my Ph.D. in Astrophysics in 2022 from Yale University under the supervision of Prof. Frank van den Bosch and Prof. Pieter van Dokkum. 
								Before that, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics from the University of Calcutta and Presidency University 
								(erstwhile Presidency College), respectively. They are both located in Kolkata, a metro city in eastern India, where I was also born and brought up.

							<h2 class="major">Dark Matter Deficient Galaxies</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								The recently discovered galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2 hereafter) has received much attention because of its low dark matter content 
								(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.555..629V/abstract" rel="external" target="_blank">van Dokkum et al. 2018a</a>, 
                                                                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...874L..12D/abstract" rel="external" target="_blank">Danieli et al. 2019</a>) 
								and a rich population of unusually bright globular clusters (GCs, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...856L..30V/abstract"
								rel="abstract" target="_blank">van Dokkum et al. 2018b</a>). While the velocity dispersions of both 
								the stars and the GC population are consistent with the absence of dark matter, they also allow for a low mass (up to about five 
								times the total stellar mass) dark matter halo. My work on this galaxy addresses the following important questions:
							</p>	
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
							
								<b> I. Is the dynamics of the GCs consistent with a stars-only mass model?</b>
								<br>
								Being massive, the GCs in DF2 are susceptible to orbital decay by losing energy via dynamical friction. Thus, if a mass model 
								for DF2 predicts very short inspiral timescales from current GC locations to the galaxy center, it is unlikely for the GCs to 
								be observed at those locations, and the said model can be ruled out. In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877..133D/abstract" 
								rel="external" target="_blank"><b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b></a>, I have used N-body simulations to investigate the impact of 
								dynamical friction on the GCs in a stars-only mass model. I have demonstrated that while the GC system does lose energy and become more 
								compact over a timescale comparable to its age (~10 Gyr), the evolution is slow (inspiral timescale for the most massive GC is at least ~4 Gyr). 
								Moreover, dynamical friction ceases to operate within the galaxy's core, a phenomenon known as core-stalling (e.g, <a href=
								"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.373.1451R/abstract" rel="external" target="_blank">Read et al. 2006</a>), and, 
								therefore, even the most massive GC can only sink as far as the core radius and no further. In addition to core-stalling, mutual scattering 
								among the GCs also keeps them dynamically buoyant, preventing them from sinking to the galaxy center. Therefore, a stars-only mass model is 
								perfectly viable as long as the GC system formed in a somewhat more extended state and slowly evolved to its current configuration.

								DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial line-of-sight positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs

								<b> II. What happens when a dark matter halo is added?</b>
								<br>
								Also, in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877..133D/abstract" rel="external" target="_blank"><b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b></a>, 
								using an approximate, semi-analytical dynamical friction prescription (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.3778P/abstract" 
								rel="external" target="_blank">Petts et al. 2015</a>), I have estimated the orbital decay timescale 
								for a typical DF2 GC in the presence of a low mass, cuspy halo, which is allowed by the kinematic constraints, and found it to be significantly shorter in the central 
								region of the galaxy compared to a stars-only mass model. Such short inspiral timescales suggest that GCs in this region would rapidly 
								sink to the galaxy center, forming a nuclear star cluster, which is not supported by observations. Therefore, although allowed by 
								kinematic constraints, it is improbable for DF2 to have a low mass, cuspy halo. However, it could still have a low mass, cored halo, 
								which would also prevent the GCs from sinking to the galaxy center, similar to a baryonic core.

								<b> III. Are GC-GC mergers relevant?</b>
								<br>
								In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877..133D/abstract" 
								rel="external" target="_blank"><b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b></a>, I modeled the GCs in DF2 as hard spheres and, therefore, could not investigate 
								the possibility of GC-GC mergers. However, as the expected internal velocity dispersions (based on measured masses and sizes) 
								of the GCs are comparable to the velocity dispersion of the GC system, such a situation may be conducive to GC-GC mergers. 
								If true, this could explain the anomalous luminosity function of the GCs. Therefore, in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903..149D/abstract"
								rel="external" target="_blank"><b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2020)</b></a>, I re-simulated some of my previous hard-sphere simulations with live-GCs. Using the live-GC simulations and analytical modeling, 
								I have demonstrated that given their number density and sizes, the GC-GC merger rate in DF2 is too low to be of any significant 
								consequence. Therefore, unless the total number of initial GCs was much higher than that at present, the unusually high masses of 
								the GCs are most likely not an outcome of past GC-GC mergers.

							<h2 class="major">Fuzzy Dark Matter</h2>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								The most popular dark matter model is Cold Dark Matter (CDM), where dark matter is collisionless and consists of weakly interacting massive 
								particles (WIMPs). However, the dearth of any direct evidence for either WIMPs (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017NatPh..13..212L/abstract"
								rel="external" target="_blank"> Liu et al. 2017</a>) or supersymmetry has resulted in a surge of alternative dark matter models. Fuzzy dark matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvD..95d3541H/abstract"
								rel="external" target="_blank"> Hui et al. 2017</a>), is one such alternative. While FDM behaves as CDM on large scales, it predicts new and exciting small-scale phenomena. FDM dynamics is governed by 
								the Schrodinger-Poisson (SP) equation, and simulations solving the SP equation show that FDM halos consist of a central core, 
								known as the soliton, surrounded by an outer envelope of oder unity density fluctuations (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014NatPh..10..496S/abstract"
								rel="external" target="_blank"> Schive et al. 2014</a>). The soliton is the ground state of the SP equation, while the envelope consists of the excited states, whose interference gives rise to the density fluctuations. The excited 
								states also interfere with the soliton, causing it to wobble and oscillate (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvL.124t1301S/abstract"
								rel="external" target="_blank"> Schive et al. 2020</a>).

								its oscillations, and the envelope density fluctuations cause nuclear objects (e.g., black holes and nuclear star clusters), initially 
								placed at rest at the soliton center, to migrate outwards with time until counteracted by dynamical friction.
