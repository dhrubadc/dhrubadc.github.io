							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								I am a Ph.D. student in Astronomy at Yale University. I am interested in the physics of dark matter, 
								whose particle nature remains unknown. I am also interested in galaxies and star clusters, how they form and evolve, 
								and how their structure and dynamics (and those of other astrophysical objects such as black holes and tidal streams) 
								can be used to learn about dark matter.
							</p>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								At Yale, I am co-advised by Frank van den Bosch and Pieter van Dokkum. Before coming to the United States, 
								I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics from the University of Calcutta and Presidency University 
								(erstwhile Presidency College), respectively. They are both located in Kolkata, a metro city in eastern India, where I was also born and brought up.

								<b> I. Orbital Decay of the Globular Clusters in NGC 1052-DF2</b>
								<br>
								The recently discovered galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2 hereafter) has received much attention because of its low dark matter content 
								and a rich population of unusually bright globular clusters (GCs). While the velocity dispersions of both the stars and the GC 
								population are consistent with the absence of dark matter, they also allow for a low mass (up to about five times the total 
								stellar mass) dark matter halo. In Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019), I have used the dyanamical friction-induced orbital decay of 
								the GCs to put additional constraints on DF2's mass distribution. Using N-body simulations and semi-analytical modeling, I 
								have demonstrated that it is unlikely for DF2 to have a low mass, cuspy dark matter halo. In such a mass model, very short 
								dynamical friction-induced orbital decay timescales in DF2's central region would cause the GCs in this region to sink to the 
								galaxy's center in a few Gyr, forming a nuclear star cluster, which is not supported by observations. On the other hand, in a 
								stars-only mass model, which has a central core (or in the presence of a low mass, cored dark matter halo), the GCs would at 
								most sink up to roughly the core radius and no further, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In a cored mass model, mutual 
								scattering among the ~10 GCs would also counter dynamical friction and help to keep them dynamically buoyant.

								simulations of the system. All 50 simulations match observational constraints on both the stellar component of 
								DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial line-of-sight positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs

								The GCs are divided into two groups of five (top and bottom panels) for clarity. In addition to the cessation of dynamical friction in the stellar core (core stalling), 
								GC–GC scattering keeps the GCs afloat, preventing them from sinking to the center of the galaxy.
