							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								I am a Ph.D. student in Astronomy at Yale University. I am interested in the physics of dark matter, 
								whose particle nature remains unknown. I am also interested in galaxies and star clusters, how they form and evolve, 
								and how their structure and dynamics (and those of other astrophysical objects such as black holes and tidal streams) 
								can be used to learn about dark matter.
							</p>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								At Yale, I am co-advised by Frank van den Bosch and Pieter van Dokkum. Before coming to the United States, 
								I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics from the University of Calcutta and Presidency University 
								(erstwhile Presidency College), respectively. They are both located in Kolkata, a metro city in eastern India, where I was also born and brought up.

							<h2 class="major">Dark Matter Deficient Galaxies</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								The recently discovered galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2 hereafter) has received much attention because of its low dark matter content 
								(van Dokkum et al. 2018a, Danieli et al. 2019) and a rich population of unusually bright globular clusters (GCs, van Dokkum et al. 2018b). 
								While the velocity dispersions of both the stars and the GC population are consistent with the absence of dark matter, they also allow 
								for a low mass (up to about five times the total stellar mass) dark matter halo. My work on this galaxy addresses the 
								following interesting questions: Is the dynamics of the GCs consistent with a stars-only mass model? What happens when a dark 
								matter halo added? Are GC-GC mergers relevant?
							</p>	
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
							
								<b> I. Is the dynamics of the GCs consistent with a stars-only mass model?</b>
								<br>
								Being massive, the GCs in DF2 are susceptible to orbital decay by losing energy via dynamical friction. Thus, if a mass model 
								for DF2 predicts very short inspiral timescales from current GC locations to the galaxy center, it is unlikely for the GCs to 
								be observed at those locations, and the said model can be ruled out. In <b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b>, I have used N-body 
								simulations to investigate the impact of dynamical friction on the GCs in a stars-only mass model. I have demonstrated that 
								while the GC system does lose energy and become more compact over a timescale comparable to its age (~10 Gyr), the evolution is 
								slow (inspiral timescale for the most massive GC is at least ~4 Gyr). Moreover, dynamical friction ceases to operate within the 
								galaxy's core, a phenomenon known as core-stalling (.e.g, Read et al. 2006), and, therefore, even the most massive GC can only 
								sink as far as the core radius and no further. In addition to core-stalling, mutual scattering among the GCs also keeps them 
								dynamically buoyant, preventing them from sinking to the galaxy center. Therefore, a stars-only mass model is perfectly viable 
								as long as the GC system formed in a somewhat more extended state and slowly evolved to its current configuration.

								DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial line-of-sight positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
							
								<b> II. What happens when a dark matter halo is added?</b>
								<br>
								Also, in <b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b>, using an approximate, semi-analytical dynamical friction prescription (Petts et al. 2015), 
								I have estimated the orbital decay timescale for a typical DF2 GC in the presence of a low mass, cuspy halo, which is allowed by 
								the kinematic constraints (van Dokkum et al. 2018a, Danieli et al. 2019), and found it to be significantly shorter in the central 
								region of the galaxy compared to a stars-only model. Such short inspiral timescales suggest that GCs in this region would rapidly 
								sink to the galaxy center, forming a nuclear star cluster, which is not supported by observations. Therefore, although allowed by 
								kinematic constraints, it is improbable for DF2 to have a low mass, cuspy halo. However, it could still have a low mass, cored halo, 
								which would also prevent the GCs from sinking to the galaxy center, similar to a baryonic core.

								GC Orbital Decay in Absence and Presence of Dark Matter: Different mass models (left panels) allowed within
								the observational constraints and dynamical friction-induced orbital decay timescales (right panels) for a typical

								matter core over a low mass, dark matter cusp.

							</p>
							
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
							
								<b> III. Are GC-GC mergers relevant?</b>
								<br>
								In <b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2019)</b>, I modeled the GCs in DF2 as hard spheres and, therefore, could not investigate 
								the possibility of GC-GC mergers. However, as the expected internal velocity dispersions (based on measured masses and sizes) 
								of the GCs are comparable to the velocity dispersion of the GC system, such a situation may be conducive to GC-GC mergers. 
								If true, this could explain the anomalous luminosity function of the GCs. Therefore, in <b>Dutta Chowdhury et al. (2020)</b>, 
								I have re-simulated some of my previous hard-sphere simulations with live-GCs. Using the live-GC simulations and analytical modeling, 
								I have demonstrated that given their number density and sizes, the GC-GC merger rate in DF2 is too low to be of any significant 
								consequence. Therefore, unless the total number of initial GCs was much higher than that at present, the unusually high masses of 
								the GCs are most likely not an outcome of past GC-GC mergers.
