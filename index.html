							<p align="justify">
								I am a Ph.D. student in Astronomy at Yale University. I am interested in the physics of dark matter, 
								whose particle nature remains unknown. I am also interested in galaxies and star clusters, how they form and evolve, 
								and how their structure and dynamics (and those of other astrophysical objects such as black holes and tidal streams) 
								can be used to learn about dark matter.
							</p>
							
							<p align="justify">
								At Yale, I am co-advised by Frank van den Bosch and Pieter van Dokkum. Before coming to the United States, 
								I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Physics from the University of Calcutta and Presidency University 
								(erstwhile Presidency College), respectively. They are both located in Kolkata, an old and beautiful mega-metropolis 
								by the bank of Ganges, in eastern India, where I was also born and brought up.
